				Hey [Name] <br><br>
				Great to see your work the other day from Nasir. We loved every bit of it. Designers are artists who create alluring masterpieces with mere threads. However, not many are aware of what goes into bringing these ideas to life. At Fashinscoop, we showcase the stories of such brands to the world. Fashinscoop is a platform with Artificial Intelligence and content at its core<br><br>
				We believe content driven commerce is the key to adding value to your purchases. Every sale is driven by meaningful content, which might be in the form of videos or articles, and that's what makes us unique. Every product has an interesting story woven into them. We shed light on such stories and ensure that the users not only engage with the brand, but with the product as a whole.<br><br>
				Powered by Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at our core, we pack in a lot more than meets the eye.<br><br>
